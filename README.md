# Tetris
### Author: Tomoya Tokunaga(mailto: ttokunag@ucsd.edu)

This repository contains source files of the game Tetris in Java language. This application originally is an assignment in my computer science class. I modified and improved the original version by adding some new features.<br>
You can play the game by first cloning or downloading this repository, and move to `src` directory under `Tetris`. Finally, please call **`make`** or **`make play`** command in the terminal if you use MacOS or Linux. For the Windows users, first `javac *.java` and then `java Main`. 

## How to Play
You can start the game by clicking the `start` button. <br>
During the play, a player can use the following keys:
1. **P**: pauses the game & resumes it
2. **S**: Speeds up (increases the game level)
3. **Left/Right arrow**: moves a block left or right
4. **Up arrow**: rotates a block counter-clockwise
5. **Down arrow**: instantaneously drops a block
